Time Series Analysis on Road Accident Data

This repository contains a project focused on time series analysis of road accident data using SQL. The dataset used in this project includes road accident records, and the analysis explores the trends, patterns, and relationships within the data to identify key insights related to the frequency and severity of accidents over time.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

Perform a time series analysis to identify trends and patterns in road accidents.
Evaluate the impact of various factors (e.g., weather, time of day, day of the week) on accident severity.
Utilize SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis, focusing on creating useful queries and aggregations.
Develop an understanding of how time-based data can be used to predict accident risk and severity.

Data Preprocessing and Analysis

The project begins with data exploration and cleaning. The accident data is preprocessed to handle missing values, ensure consistency, and create derived variables (such as the hour of the day, day of the week, and month). Key steps include:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing data and outliers.

Feature Engineering: Creating new time-related features (e.g., time of day, holiday indicators).

Data Aggregation: Using SQL queries to group data by time periods and accident severity.

Time Series Analysis

Trends: Identifying seasonal or periodic trends in accident frequency.

Patterns: Analyzing accidents by hour of the day, day of the week, and month to find patterns of peak accident times.

Impact of External Factors: Investigating how factors like weather or time of day influence the severity of accidents.

Forecasting: Using time series forecasting methods to predict future accident occurrences.

SQL Queries and ERD

A significant portion of the project involves writing SQL queries to:

Aggregate accident data by various time-based dimensions (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

Join multiple tables to understand the relationships between accident severity, time, and other factors.

Create complex queries for trend analysis and reporting.

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is also included to illustrate the database structure and the relationships between different tables.
